# sports_analytics classifiers

Here we build 2 types of classifiers. One to classify the actions in the MCS dataset. 
Here we implement MLp and LSTM model to classify action. 
Then we further do a MCS score prediction. We implement this using MLP, Random Forest and XGBoost. 

The preprocessed data for MCS Dataset can be found here -
